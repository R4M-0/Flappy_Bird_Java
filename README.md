## Description
This is a simple Flappy Bird clone built using Java and the Swing library. The game features basic physics, collision detection, and an increasing difficulty level as the player progresses.

## Features
- Classic Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics
- Gravity-based physics
- Collision detection with pipes and ground
- Score tracking system
- Simple, intuitive controls

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Swing (for GUI rendering)
- Timer (for game loop management)

## Installation and Running the Game
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Java 8 or later)
